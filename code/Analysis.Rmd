### **Executive Summary**

The airline industry generates billions of dollars in revenue each year
and employs hundreds of thousands of people. However, it operates in a
very fragile ecosystem that is easily affected by various variables
Thus, we want to take a closer look at the factors which may affect this
widespread industry.

One of the key metrics to measure airline performance is the number of
passengers flying on average per day in a given route.

This metric can help us in optimizing resources such as:

-   Number of flights scheduled on that route

-   Staffs deployed

-   New promotions to be applied etc.

Given our panel data, we want to understand what factors affect our
metric of interest.

Our data spans over 4 years (1997 - 2000) and has 4596 observations
spread over 7 features. The unit of observation is the combination of
origin and destination airport cities, target variable is Number of
passengers flying on average per day and the Independent variables are
Fare (average one way fare), and Market Share (market fraction of the
biggest carrier).

The primary objective of this analysis is to test the causal
relationship of the air fare of that route with the average number of
passengers per day and the biggest carrier's market share for that
route. The secondary objective of this analysis is to recommend a
business strategy based on the results of the primary objective.

Since the data is observational without any scope of randomly assigning
routes into treatment and control groups, methods such as Instrument
Variable, Fixed Effect Regression and Random Effect Regression were used
to establish any causality between the dependent variable and the
independent variables.

Our conclusion is that with each dollar increase in the airline fare,
the passenger count for the trip decreases by 0.45% and With each
percent increase in market share by the biggest carrier, the passenger
count decreases by 7.2%

#### **Threats to causal inference**

-   **Omitted Variable:** Unknown variables such as the population of
    the destination city can affect the passengers traveling on a routeÂ 

-   **Measurement Error:** We assume that there is no measurement error
    and outlier situations such as system glitches are disregarded for
    our analysis

-   **Simultaneity:** The fare and number of passengers can affect each
    other simultaneously. If the fare increases then the number of
    passengers will decrease which will prompt the fare to decrease

-   **Selection Bias:** We assume that data collection has been done
    randomly and is representative of the real world behavior

### **Assumptions**

-   We assume that our dataset only contains time invariant confounding
    variables

-   We use an instrument variable approach, which has the following
    assumptions:

    -   **Relevance criterion:** The independent variable and Instrument
        should be correlated, which is called as relevance criterion

    -   **Exclusion criterion:** The error term and Instrument should
        not be correlated. Note that while the relevance criterion can
        be tested, exclusion criterion cannot be tested.

### **Data Summary**

The dataset used is a panel dataset spanning four years (1997-2000),
collected from data sets used in 'Econometric Analysis of Cross Section
and Panel Data' By Jeffrey Wooldridge.

It contains 4,596 observations over 7 features such as 'Year', 'Origin
Airport', 'Distance' and so on (Appendix 1.1).

The unit of observation is the combination of origin and destination
airport cities. The target variable is Number of passengers flying on
average per day. The Independent variables are Fare (average one way
fare), and Market Share (market fraction of the biggest carrier).

As the target variable is right skewed, we will be taking the log of no.
of passengers in the analysis (Appendix 1.2). The column 'lpassen'
contains the log of the passenger variable.

### **Analysis**

**OLS Regression**

First, we performed a simple OLS regression to understand how number of
passengers is related to fare and biggest carrier's market share in that
route (Appendix 2.1).

However, as the independent variable "fare" and the dependent variable
"number of passengers" can affect each other, potential simultaneity is
a major endogeneity issue prior to establishing causality in our
project. To address this, we are taking an instrumental variable as it
can overcome correlation from other source of endogeneity in X and
resolve simultaneity and possible omitted variable bias and measurement
error.

**Instrumental Variables Approach**

A good instrument is an exogenous variable that strongly influences the
independent variable (variable of interest) and does not impact the
final outcome of interest except through the interested independent
variable. Therefore, the instrument should not be correlated with the
dependent variable Y.

Variable "Distance" which indicates the distance between the origin and
destination of the flight from the dataset is observed to be a good
instrument based on its high correlation with price (0.63) and no or low
correlation with the number of passengers (-0.09) (Appendix 1.3).

2SLS: Two-stage least squares (Appendix 2.2.1)

1.  We regress fare onto the distance variable, recover the predicted
    values, and use them for the second stage of regression

2.  Regress number of passengers onto predicted values of price

![](C:/Users/pankh/AppData/Local/RStudio/tmp/paste-CFB804CC.png){width="478"
height="29"}

The high F score of 2923 in the first regression indicates that distance
is indeed a strong instrument.

Note: This gives a consistent estimate of the beta value but the
standard errors are wrong as the software doesn't recognize the usage of
predicted price variable

Prior to interpreting the effect of price on the number of passengers,
the instrument should be evaluated and this has been done by IV reg
diagnostics. The test statistics of the IV reg are described below
(Appendix 2.2.2)

*Weak IV Test:*

This is typically based on first-stage F-stat. P value of \<2e-16
\*\*\*, implies we reject the null of

weak instruments with statistical significance

*Wu-Hausman Test:*

The null hypothesis is that IV yields equivalent estimates to OLS. The P
value of 0.127 implies that we

don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis with
statistical significance. Thus we should

not use instrument distance because we are losing power by doing so, and
getting wider standard

errors than necessary

### 

**Fixed Effect and Random Effect Regression:**

Both methods are good panel data estimation techniques. There might be
variables other than the ones present in this dataset that might affect
causality. Such confounding variables that may affect causality are
dealt with in both the methods but in different ways.

Consider the regression equation -

Passengersit = b0 + b1\*Fareit + b2\*Mkt. Shareit + b3\*Confoundit + eit

where 'i' represents each route in the dataset; 't' represents each time
period

**Fixed Effect Regression:** The new intercept becomes (b0 +
b3\*Confoundi). In fixed effect, the confound term may or may not be
correlated with the independent variables (fare and biggest carrier's
market share in this case).

Passengersit = (b0 + b3\*Confoundi) + b1\*Fareit + b2\*Mkt. Shareit +
eit

**Random Effect Regression:** The assumption in this method is that the
confounds are time invariant for each unit of observation. The confound
term in the above regression equation is treated as a random variable
and the confound term is now a part of the error term. The confound term
in the above equation is assumed to be uncorrelated with the independent
variables (fare and biggest carrier's market share in this case).

Passengersit = b0 + b1\*Fareit + b2\*Mkt. Shareit + (eit +
b3\*Confoundi)

There are three different techniques in fixed effect through which we
can eliminate the time invariant confounds -- demeaning, dummy variables
and first difference. We used demeaning for this project. This technique
eliminates the confound variables by subtracting the means from every
term of the regression equation, therefore there will be no more
intercept term in the regression results.

The resulting equation is as follows:

Fixed Effects (Appendix 2.3.1):

No. of passengers = -0.0045\*Fare - 0.072\*Biggest Carrier's Mkt Share +
e

Random Effects (Appendix 2.3.2):

No. of passengers = 6.84 - 0.0041\*Fare - 0.125\*Biggest Carrier's Mkt
Share + e

To decide which method to use to find the casual relationship, Hausman's
test was conducted. The test gave a p-value of 1.281e-12 (Appendix
2.3.3), which means the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that
Fixed Effect Regression works best in this case.

### **Conclusion**

From the fixed effect regression results, the observations were:

-   With each dollar increase in the airline fare, the passenger count
    for the trip to be decreased by 0.45%

-   With each percent increase in market share by the biggest carrier,
    the passenger count to decrease by 7.2%

### **Recommendation**

Niche or upcoming airlines should have competitive pricing to increase
their passenger volume, to counter the airlines with a bigger market
share.

This will have more impact if implemented on routes in which the biggest
market share value is high.

### **Limitations**

-   Time variant confounding variables could be present which are not
    addressed

-   Data is old and might not be completely applicable to today's
    airline industry. It would be helpful to perform this analysis with
    newer data set

-   Since the dataset only spans over 4 years, we might miss out on
    industry changes that happened over longer periods of time (such as
    oil wars, market collapses etc.) Thus, in future we can perform this
    analysis using a longer ranged data set\
