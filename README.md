# Causal Analysis for Airline Pricing

## Introduction
What causes the changes in flight charges? In this project, we try to check if there is a direct causality between pricing and different perceived factors.

## Code
Entire analysis has been done on R. The [code](code/Analysis.Rmd) contains the analysis and the supporting logic.

## Analysis
We used Instrumental Variables as a technique to establish causality.
